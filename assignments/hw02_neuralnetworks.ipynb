It's a commonly used dataset for training and testing machine learning models, because it contains real word examples, it's not that big, so it's fast to try out learning algorithms and experiment on this. The dataset is a subset of a larger database collected by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the 90's. The purpose of collecting the dataset to create a database which can be used to create algorithms to be used in automatic ZIP code reader systems. The numbers in the training set was taken from American Census Bureau:\n",

This was the reason for creating the MNIST (the images also was normalized to fit into 28x28 pixel and transformed to grayscale). In 2017 a larger dataset (EMNIST) was created from the original data containing 240000 training images and 40000 testing images. "
